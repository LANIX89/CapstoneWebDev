              Motivated by the urgency of the need to serve the youth of a
              burgeoning Taguig City, the Local Government Administration came
              up with Ordinance No. 29 series 2004 "An Ordinance Establishing
              the Pamantasan ng Taguig and Appropriate Funds Thereof." This was
              also one of the offshoots of the provision of the Local Government
              Code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pamantasan ng Taguig was renamed Taguig City University pursuant
              to City Ordinance No. 13, series of 2009.

              Building TCU was not laid on a golden platter. It has gone through
              various forms of birth pangs top-billed by the very basic need to
              have enough school buildings. For two years, despite its birthing
              courage, the pipedream hardly manifested its physical eloquence,
              but in S. Y. 2006-2007, its realization swiftly took off. The
              organization of the University and construction of the TCU main
              building commended. Meanwhile, undergraduate classes were held in
              various elementary and high school campuses, all in Taguig lent to
              the growing management of TCU.

              In 2006, General Ricardo Papa Sr. Memorial High School offered
              some rooms for free. In 2007, rooms expanded to Taguig Elementary
              School, Sta. Ana District 1, and Em's Elementary School in SIgnal
              Village-District 2. In 2008-2009, additional undergraduate classes
              were held in annex schools of General Ricardo Papa Sr. Memorial
              High School at Brgy. Ususan and Signal Village Elementary School
              (Annex) in the same place
